## Florida Tech Broadcast Assistant + Overlay      
Note: You must have Rocket League Bakkesmod and the Bakkesmod SOS plugin for rocket league to connect to in game state. However configuring the overlay will still work.    

# Assistant   
Built using Tauri + Next.js. Runs a rust websocket server on a seperate thread for the overlay to connect and receive team configuration.
